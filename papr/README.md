# PAPR

## ISSUES

Currently the lists are not tamperproof, as they are not yet connected to a blockchain. This does not affect the simulations that we run but must be fixed for a real-world application. There exists some bitcoin integration in our (PAPR Money implementation)[papr_money], but the publishing of hashes of the lists to a blockchain is still not fully operational.
